        <p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and shared universe centered on a series
            of superhero films produced by Marvel Studios. The films are based on characters that appear in American
            comic books published by Marvel Comics. The franchise also includes television series, short films, digital
            series, and literature. The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was
            established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters.

            Marvel Studios releases its films in groups called "Phases", with the first three phases collectively known
            as "The Infinity Saga" and the following three phases as "The Multiverse Saga". The first MCU film, Iron Man
            (2008), began Phase One, which culminated in the 2012 crossover film The Avengers. Phase Two began with Iron
            Man 3 (2013) and concluded with Ant-Man (2015). Phase Three began with Captain America: Civil War (2016) and
            concluded with Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). Phase Four began with Black Widow (2021) and will conclude
            with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022). Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) will begin Phase Five,
            which will end with Thunderbolts (2024), and Phase Six begins with Fantastic Four (2024). Phase Six and "The
            Multiverse Saga" will conclude with Avengers: The Kang Dynasty (2025) and Avengers: Secret Wars (2025).

            Marvel Television expanded the universe to network television with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC in 2013
            before further expanding to streaming television on Netflix and Hulu and to cable television on Freeform.
            They also produced the digital series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot. Marvel Studios began producing
            their own television series for streaming on Disney+, starting with WandaVision in 2021 as the beginning of
            Phase Four. The MCU also includes tie-in comics published by Marvel Comics, a series of direct-to-video
            short films called Marvel One-Shots, and viral marketing campaigns for the films featuring the faux news
            programs WHIH Newsfront and The Daily Bugle.

            The franchise has been commercially successful and generally received positive reviews. It has inspired
            other film and television studios to attempt similar shared universes, and has also inspired several themed
            attractions, an art exhibit, television specials, guidebooks for each film, multiple tie-in video games, and
            commercials.</p>
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2">Team</h4>
        <p>The Avengers were a team of superheroes assembled by Nick Fury and the intelligence agency S.H.I.E.L.D.
            through the Avengers Initiative, originally Nick intended it to be called the Protectors Initiative.

            The original team consisted of Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye. They were
            brought together by S.H.I.E.L.D. to combat Loki, Thor's adoptive brother. The team was initially formed by
            Nick Fury to "fight the battles that S.H.I.E.L.D. never could".

            After Ultron's defeat, Tony Stark, Hawkeye and Hulk left the team, and the Avengers were disbanded. The
            government then introduced the Sokovia Accords meaning heroes had to be registered and agree to only act
            when the government allowed it. Tony Stark supported the Accords, but a small group consisting of Captain
            America, Black Widow, Falcon, Ant-Man, Scarlet Witch, Winter Soldier and Hawkeye rebelled against the
            Sokovia Accords.

            Following the fallout of the Avengers Civil War, Captain America, Black Widow and Falcon all continued to
            work in the shadows. When Thanos and the Black Order came to Earth to gather the Infinity Stones, the
            Avengers were reassembled by Steve, but many fell to the Decimation. Approximately three weeks later, they
            tracked down Thanos and killed him.

            Five years later, with the help of Scott Lang, the Avengers were able to use the Pym Particles to travel
            into the past to retrieve the Infinity Stones and reverse the Decimation, the Avengers, along side the
            restored fallen Avengers, Masters of the Mystic Arts, the Guardians of the Galaxy, the armies of Wakanda,
            New Asgard and the Ravagers were finally able to defeat Thanos and his forces. However, Tony Stark and Black
            Widow sacrificed themselves to save the world. Captain America also chose to remain in the past so that he
            could live a life with Peggy Carter and the remaining team disbanded.</p>

        <p>The Avengers are a fictional team of superheroes and the protagonists of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)
            media franchise, based on the Marvel Comics team of the same name created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in
            1963. Founded by S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury, the team is a United States-based organization composed
            primarily of superpowered and gifted individuals, described as "Earth's Mightiest Heroes", who are committed
            to the world's protection from a variety of threats. The Avengers are depicted as operating in the state of
            New York: originally from the Avengers Tower in Midtown Manhattan and subsequently from the Avengers
            Compound in Upstate New York.

            The concept of the Avengers was teased in the post-credits scene of Iron Man (2008), the first MCU film, by
            Nick Fury as an initiative planned by him. The concept was further explored in Iron Man 2 (2010), with the
            introduction of Natasha Romanoff. The team was eventually established in the crossover-style film The
            Avengers (2012), which, followed by Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and
            Avengers: Endgame (2019), established a series of four films that headlined the MCU and became the sixth
            highest-grossing film series of all time, with the MCU franchise overall ranking first. Arranged as an
            ensemble of core MCU characters such as Iron Man, Captain America and Thor, they are central to the MCU's
            Infinity Saga and have been acclaimed as an important part of the franchise. The Avengers are set to return
            in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars, both releasing in 2025, as the conclusion of the
            MCU's Multiverse Saga.</p>
